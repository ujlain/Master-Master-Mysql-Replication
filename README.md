# Master-Master-Mysql-Replication
Master to Master Mysql Replication checking using GAMBAS 3.0 

This GUI (written in GAMBAS 3.0) is meant to run of either of or both masters. 
Since it is a monitoring aid, it could even run on 3rd machine (but with adequate user rights to make MySql connection to participating severs)
